# About Me

I've lived a long life thus far, I'm 70 years young. During my working carreer I worked as a Software Engineer for about 35 Years. I started out as a COBOL programmer for Digital Equipment Corporation. 

During my life as an Engineer I taught myself python, tkinter, and many other technologies. These days I spend my time creating websites using such tools as Jekyll, hugo, and Astro. 

For the last four years I have spent my life in the Philippines. I am married to a beautiful filopina. I have two beautiful step-daughters which I am in the process of 
adopting. So life is good.  

Now, if you want me to do some work for you remotely I am open to it. Just drop me a 
line see my contact page for ways to contact me.
